# Moxie
While points are earned for winning races, points are also earned through moxie. This means that you could build the fastest racer, prioritising function over form yet still not win. Racers need to be interesting/entertaining in some way, not just a go kart.

Moxie points are awarded by the crowd, choosing thier favourites so racers should focus not only on the racing aspect, but entertaining the crowd as well. This could come from the design of your racer, your costume or such. You are trying to convince the public to vote for you rather than your peers.

* Counting Moxie Points

Moxie points are submitted on a physical button board. Each Racer is allowed a 6x1.75 inch label, plaque or such to let the public know who they are voting for. More details of this can be found in the rules.
If this is not clear, the crowd does not know how to vote for you!
