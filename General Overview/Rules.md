# Rules

Hacky Racers are constructed and raced to a ruleset primarily intended to
	* Ensure safety of participants and spectators,
	* Manage allowable power limits for safety and keep a level playing field,
	* Limit monetary spending to maintain accessability.

While building a hacky racer, take care to follow these rules. *If you fail to do so your racer will not pass a technical inspection, and will not be allowed to race.*

The current ruleset is 2019 and can be found [here](http://hackyracers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hacky-Racers-Rules-2019-1.pdf)

There are current six sections of the rule document, covering the following:
	* Car Construction Rules
	* Driver Rules
	* Team Rules
	* General Event Rules
	* Race Rules
	* Season Structure Rules

If you are in any doubt about anything, please ask.
