# Bill Of Materials (BOM)

Each racer must submit a bill of materials at each event, detailing the parts of the vehicle that count towards the budget. (see the rules for more information about the budget and BOM).

Some items are exluded from the budget or have a variable price set in the rules. Safety equipment for example is excuded from the BOM, so don't skimp on it to try and save money!

There are penalties for budget offences, therefore a good BOM is required to justify your vehicle. If you are suspected of greatly exceeding the budget, not only is this not in the spirit of the racing, but you are liable to a buy out at the value of the maximum budget. More details can be found in section 1.14.4 of the rules.
