# Batteries

Hacky Racers are electric vehicles, therefore they need some sort of power supply. In a traditional combustion engined go kart this would be petrol stored in a tank. While we could race with various extension leads, or scalextrix style power lines batteries are a much better option.

More detailed information about batteries can be found in the rules.

There are a few different types of batteries that are applicable and allowed for use in Hacky Racers. These are:

	* SLA: Sealed Lead acid
	* AGM: Abosrbed Glass Mat Lead acid
	* Ni-Cd: Nickel-Cadmium
	* Ni-Mh: Nickel-Metal Hydride
	* LiFePO4: Lithium Ion Phosphate
	* LiPO/Li-Ion: Lithium Polymer/Ion

Most racers choose to use SLA or AGM for lower power/slower vehicles. These batteries are fundamentally simple, however are heavy and less power dense than Lithium Options. They require a very basic charger and are very safe, unless you drop one on your toes.

Lithium can often also supply more current, and can do so very quickly, leading to faster acceleration in some cases.

Lithium batteries are generally incredibly power dense, and beginning to become less expensive thanks to readily available RC hobby batteries.
Lithium Ion Phosphate batteries are generally very safe and are much better than lead-acid style batteries.

Lithium Polymer/Ion Batteries are currently the best battery technology available in terms of power density, output and form factor. These do however require more care to use safely.
