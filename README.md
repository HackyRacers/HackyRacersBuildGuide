# Cheap, small electric vehicle racing.
Hacky Racers is a community of likeminded people who build and race small electric vehicles to a set of rules.
These vehicles should have a wacky, entertaining or recognisable theme rather than being intricately engineered racing machines. Points are awarded for this as well as race position!

Hacky Racers is an offshkkt of a similar US based group, the Power Racing Series.

Want to get involved? This is the right place to find some guidance on your build!
