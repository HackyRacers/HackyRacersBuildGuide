# Cheap, small electric vehicle racing.
Hacky Racers is a community of likeminded people who build and race small electric vehicles to a set of rules.
These vehicles should have a wacky, entertaining or recognisable theme rather than being intricately engineered racing machines. Points are awarded for this as well as race position!

Hacky Racers is an offshoot of a similar US based group, the Power Racing Series.

Want to get involved? This is the right place to find some guidance on your build!
This repository (will) contain multiple documents containing information about all respective parts of construction, and racing of your vehicle.

A note about Hacky Racers, many people think that to build a racer you need to have many skills and have access to lots of equipment such as welders, while these can be helpful it is very possible to build a competitive racer with basic tools and off the shelf conponents.
